## About me

I'm currently a second year PhD student in the [Dias and Frazer lab](https://www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/dias-frazer-lab).

I'm interested in applications of scalable probabilistic modelling and machine learning in biology. My research concerns how models of diverse evolutionary sequence data can teach us about human health and I'm currently working on modelling of protein sequences across the tree of life.

I previously worked at [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) in the machine learning operations department, evaluating and improving basecaller models.

I also have an interest in how techniques from pure mathematics can be applied to biology, working previously on computational algebraic topology for disease diagnosis.
