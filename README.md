## About me

I'm a PhD student in the [Dias and Frazer lab](https://www.crg.eu/en/programmes-groups/dias-frazer-lab) at the [CRG](https://www.crg.eu) in Barcelona.

I'm interested in applications of scalable probabilistic modelling and machine learning in biology. My research concerns how models of diverse evolutionary sequence data can teach us about human health.

I previously worked at [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) in the machine learning operations department, evaluating and improving basecaller models.

I also have an interest in how techniques from pure mathematics can be applied to biology, working previously on computational algebraic topology for disease diagnosis.
